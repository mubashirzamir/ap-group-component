## Instructions for Development

## Running the Authentication Server and Frontend

### Authentication Server

1. **Build the Authentication Server**  
   Navigate to the backend directory and build the jar file using Maven:

   ```bash
   cd /backend/master_gateway
   ./mvnw clean install
   cd /target

2. **Run the Authentication Server**  
   Run the jar file:

   ```bash
   java -jar master_gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

### Frontend

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd /frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 1. Individual Assessment

Place your individual assessment files in the appropriate directory:

- `/backend/city/individual_assessment` (e.g., `/backend/newcastle/individual_assessment` for Newcastle)

### 2. Frontend Development

To start developing the frontend, focus on modifying the files for your specific city located at:

- `/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Cities/YourCityName`

For example, you can refer to `/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Cities/Newcastle` for guidance on how to structure your
city‚Äôs dashboard.

### 3. Configuration

#### API Base Path

##### Development

Add your city‚Äôs API base path to the `.env.development` file in the `/frontend` directory. For example:

- e.g. `VITE_NEWCASTLE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/city/newcastle`
- To authenticate requests through the master gateway, use the master gateway URL: `http://localhost:8080/city/<your-city-name>`.
  - Make sure the `application.yml` file in the `master_gateway` project is configured for your city.

##### Production

Add your city‚Äôs API base path to the `.env.production` file in the `/frontend` directory. For example:

- For this step your individual assessment should be deployed somewhere with a public URL.
  - A simple way to do this is to use ngrok to expose your localhost to the internet: https://ngrok.com/blog-post/free-static-domains-ngrok-users
- e.g. `VITE_NEWCASTLE_API_BASE_URL=https://gateway-ap-group-component.onrender.com/city/newcastle`
- To authenticate requests through the master gateway, use the master gateway URL: `https://gateway-ap-group-component.onrender.com/city/<your-city-name>`.
  - Make sure the `application.yml` file in the `master_gateway` project is configured for your city.

#### Service File

Create a service file to communicate with your API gateway for your city. The file should be located in:

- `/frontend/src/services/YourCityNameService.js`

For example, for Newcastle, the file path would be `/frontend/src/services/NewcastleService.js`.

---

## CORS Configuration

You might need to enable CORS in the API Gateways to avoid CORS errors.

You can enable CORS in your API Gateway by modifying the `application.properties` file located in:

- `/backend/newcastle/individual-assessment/individual-assessment/gateway/src/main/resources/application.properties`

## Git Workflow Instructions

1. **Branching Out from Main**
   - Always create a new branch from the `main` branch before making any changes.
   - Name the branch after yourself for easier identification. For example:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git checkout -b your-name
     ```

2. **Making Changes**
   - Work on your own branch and commit your changes regularly.
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
     ```

3. **Keeping Your Branch Updated with Main**
   - Regularly pull changes from the `main` branch into your branch to keep it updated and avoid merge conflicts:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git checkout your-name
     git merge main
     ```

4. **Creating a Pull Request**
   - Once your changes are ready, push your branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-name
     ```
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) on the repository, targeting the `main` branch.
   - Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `main` before creating the PR.

5. **Avoid Pushing Directly to Main**
   - **Do not push your changes directly to the `main` branch**. Always create a Pull Request and wait for it to be reviewed and approved.

By following these steps, we can maintain a clean workflow and minimize merge conflicts.

## Adding Routes to `application.yml` in `master_gateway`

If you want your city-specific routes to be proxied through the main gateway, you need to add the routes to the `application.yml` file in the `master_gateway` project.

```yaml
allowed_origins: http://localhost:5173
server:
  port: 8080
spring:
  application:
    name: master_gateway

  cloud:
    gateway:
      mvc:
        routes:
          - id: newcastle-service
            uri: http://localhost:8081
            predicates:
              - Path=/city/newcastle/**
            filters:
              - stripPrefix=2
              - DedupeResponseHeader=Access-Control-Allow-Credentials Access-Control-Allow-Origin
          - id: your-city-service
            uri: http://localhost:<your-port> // or any other URL if your service is hosted elsewhere
            predicates:
              - Path=/city/your-city/**
            filters:
              - stripPrefix=2
              - DedupeResponseHeader=Access-Control-Allow-Credentials Access-Control-Allow-Origin
```

This configuration ensures that the main gateway properly proxies requests to your city's backend microservice while applying the necessary authentication filters.
